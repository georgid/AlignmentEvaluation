NAME: AlignmentEvaluation

DESCRIPTION 

A tool for evaluation of absolute alignment error of tokens.
Done to evaluate results of a system for lyrics-2-audio alignment on different levels (a token could be phoneme, word or phrase - a group of words )
Extendable to the evaluation for any token-based alignment (e.g. if token is word, phrase, note, section )
Considers begin timestamp and end timestamp of each token.
 
 detected file format :  mlf format of htk 
 annotation file format: TextGrid of www.praat.org/ 
 
 the detected result can be a text file of triples (begin timestamp, end timestamp, tokenID) : see method WordLevelEvaluator._evalAlignmentError() 
 the annotation can be in www.sonicvisualiser.org (can be provided on request with code in sonicVisTextPhnDir2mlf.py)
 
Algorithm is token-identities-agnostic, e.g. it does not try to match token-IDs between detected result and annotation, but proceeds successively one-by-one  

Note that if a single boundary is detected between two tokens it is considered once as end of preceding annotation token  and beginning of following annotation token, which makes the metric rather strict

As well there is a module to convert automatically the decoded result to Praat's TextGrid format.
This enables the  visualization of the decoding result together with the groundTruth in Praat:
see PraatVisualiser.openTextGridInPraatopenTextGridInPraat : opens the text Grid in Praat

Enjoy!

---------------------------------------- 
EXAMPLE USAGE: 

see: main method of WordLevelEvlauator

if decoded result is:
 
startTs endTs phonemeOrWord
0.0		1.11	sil
1.11	2.41	usagi
2.41	2.90	usagi
2.90	3.38	sp
3.38	4.15	nani

and annotation <>.TextGrid is 
beginTs 	usagi usagi 
endTs 	nani

Then the two detected phrases are considered to evaluate:  
1.11 2.90 usagi usagi 
and 
3.38 4.15	nani


To change extensions edit variables in WordLevelEvaluator 
ANNOTATION_EXT = '.TextGrid'
DETECTED_EXT = '.dtwDurationAligned'
when parsing TextGrid: tier_names are expected as defined in TextGrid_Parsing

As well make sure to change the path to your installed Praat program:
PraatVisualiser.PATH_TO_PRAAT
